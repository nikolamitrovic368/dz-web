## David Zwirner webapp

This system contains the codebase of our main webapp.

You will find the Sanity studio under the `[/studio](https://cms.zwirner.tech/)`.

## Local development setup

Follow these instructions to deploy a local environment of the webpage.

1. Install Git. [Here](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git) the guide.

2. Install Docker in your machine. [Here](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) the official guide for Windows, Mac and Linux users.

3. **Windows and Linux only**: Install [Docker compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) in your machine. ([Docker for Mac already includes Compose](https://docs.docker.com.xy2401.com/v17.12/compose/install/#:~:text=Docker%20for%20Mac%20and%20Docker,need%20to%20install%20Compose%20separately.)).

4. Clone this repository in your machine using Git.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/Zwirner/zwirnerweb.git
```

5. Create a Github access token: Go to https://github.com/settings/tokens, click on the _Generate new token_ button, choose _Generate new token (classic)_, set a meaningful name like "DZ Package", and make sure you **tick the _read:packages | Download packages from GitHub Package Registry_ option**. Click on Save and copy the token you just created.

6. Duplicate the `.env.local.example` file and rename it as `.env`. Ask engineering for the `SANITY_API_READ_TOKEN` value, and replace it in that file. Also, replace the value of the `GH_TOKEN` variable with the token you created in the previous step.

7. Open the project folder and let Docker Compose to install everything for you running the following command.

```sh
docker-compose up -d
```

8. VoilÃ ! Open this URL http://localhost:3000/ and you should see the system working.

> In case you want to manually install node and yarn to run this app outside the docker container, please make sure you use **Node 19**, and **Yarn 3 (berry)**.

# Updating your the dev database with latest changes done in prod

Login to sanity cli running the following command in a terminal.

```bash
docker-compose exec zwirnerweb yarn sanity login
```

Choose _Google_ as the login type, open the URL that the terminal will show you, and sign in with your David Zwirner google account. If everything went well you should see a message like this:

```bash
Login successful
```

Run this script to sync the dev database with prod

```bash
docker-compose exec zwirnerweb yarn sync-dev-db
```
